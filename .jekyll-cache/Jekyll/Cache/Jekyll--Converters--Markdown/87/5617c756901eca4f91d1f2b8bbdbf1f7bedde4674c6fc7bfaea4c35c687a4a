I"©<p>The privileged within us often has a peculiar fear, of the highest degree. A fear that keeps on an internal tussle, to keep building a palace of superiority complex. Yes, a palace, vast, yet empty within, with mirages of a future, bigger and better than the neighbour.</p>

<p>It makes us hungry for more, it makes us dangerous, but what persists in the end is just the fear.</p>

<p>Are you <strong>fearful</strong>?</p>
