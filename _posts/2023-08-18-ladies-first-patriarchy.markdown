About a year ago, my life changed when I discovered that I am allergic to dairy. The sad part ends here. Fast-forward, I have been discovering recipes that do not aggravate my allergies. Guess what, I have managed to keep them healthier as wellâ€”no added sugar! The following one has some cheating on the sugar front, as it just makes it drool-worthy.

Without making you wait any further, I present my recipe, which I hate to call a pancake, but for the lack of a better term, I will. There are two versions of it, a vegan, and another, a non-vegan one.

## Non-vegan
#### Ingredients
    -   Rolled Oats (preferably whole grain): 1 tbsp
    -   Pure Cacao Powder: 1 tsp
    -   Water
    -   Egg: 1
    -   Ripe Banana: 2
    -   Oil (your choice):  1 tsp
    -   Walnuts: 4 kernels, soaked overnight (no hard limit on quantity)
    -   Almonds: 6, soaked overnight (no hard limit on quantity)
    -   Sunflower seeds: 1 tbsp
    -   Pumpkin seeds: 1 tbsp
    -   Honey or Maple Syrup: 1 tsp
    -   Pistachio: Be generous, chopped
    
#### Let's Cook!
1. Take the oats in a cup or bowl.
2. Add the pure Cocoa powder to the oats. You can be generous with the chocolate as per your liking.
3. Add a small amount of water to the oats and let it soak for 10-15 mins.
4. Add the egg to the soaked oats and whisk it to make a mixture.
5. Chop a ripe banana in small cubicles and add it to the above mixture.
6. Pour oil on a pan and heat it for a while.
7. Pour the mixture (oats, chocolate, egg, banana) on the pan and spread it around.
8. Flip the pancake to cook it well from the other side also.
9. Once you are satisfied that it is cooked well, take it out on a plate.
10. Chop another banana into small cubicles and spread them across the pancake.
11. Add a generous amount of chopped nuts: walnuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds.
12. Pour honey or maple syrup on the top. You can be generous with it if you have a sweet tooth.
13. Spread roughly chopped pistachios on top.

**Enjoy!**

## Vegan
#### Ingredients
The ingredients remain the same as the non-vegan version, except for the following.
    
    Remove:
        -   Eggs
        -   Honey
    
    Add:
        -   Flour: 1 tsp
        -   Maple Syrup: 1 tsp

#### The Recipe
The recipe is the similar as the above,

1. Mix half a teaspoon of flour with the oats and the chocolate powder before soaking. This will ensure that the mixture binds well when cooked. The quantity of water should be regulated to ensure that the mixture is not dry, but not running either.
2. Do not add the egg. The gluten from the flour is the replacement.
3. Use maple syrup instead of honey.

The quantities mentioned above are all approximate and can be played around with based on personal preferences, .e.g, instead of two bananas use only one with half of it in each of the stages mentioned.


I hope you like the *pancake*!

Coming soon your way -- a vegan, gluten free, no added sugar - CHEESCAKE!!! I am excited, **are you?**
